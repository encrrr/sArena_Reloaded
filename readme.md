# sArena Reloaded
New and updated sArena Frames with tons of new great features. Fork of sArena addon made by Stako, and maintained by many in the PvP community.

This is a further improvement of my sArena MoP Classic addon and it also brings it to Retail. This version will work on both Retail and MoP. This version will let you import settings from both sArena MoP and sArena Updated 2 by sammers.

This version comes packed with many new features such as:

*   Three new layouts and one updated one.
*   Import/Export feature for Profile Sharing.
*   A smarter aura priority system
*   Many new customisation options such as Texture, Font, Dark Mode, Icon Crop, Modern Castbars, Masque support, etc.
*   Put a unique texture on Healers specifically, or only when there is Class Stacking.
*   Show shields and overshields on healthbars.
*   Hunter's Feign Death does not show up as dead but instead gets faded out a little bit.
*   Castbars immediately hide for easier interrupts.

Other improvements:
*   Interrupts take interrupt duration reduction auras into account
*   Healer Icon Replacement option
*   Bright DR setting to more easily destinguish DR amount.
*   Decimals on default CD Timer below 6 seconds.
*   Color Trinket setting to display Trinket CD as a flat Green/Red texture.
*   Option to display DR status as Text.
*   Spec text on frames.

And everything else you'd expect from Arena Frames.
