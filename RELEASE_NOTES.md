2.2.6
- New "DR Text" size and position settings in the Layout: Text Settings section. (The DR amount text, not the cooldown text)
- "Spec Names on Manabar" setting now available in Layout settings for all layouts and not just a few of them.
- New "Disable Overshields" setting (Global -> Misc)
- Fix DR Icons unintentionally staying cropped when DR Border was disabled (and Cropped Icons was not enabled)
- Fix Gladiuish layout's Trinket, Racial & Dispel default size from 41 to 40. You might have to retweak size/position. Apologies for the inconvenience. Boring info: They were larger than the frames height because the default icons (when not cropped) have an ugly and inconsistent border around them and it was done to make them at least appear visually the same. However this just caues headache with both the cooldown spiral on top and also when crop borders is enabled. Should now be pixel perfect even though it may not look like it without cropped icons setting, feel free to tweak that with size if you want
