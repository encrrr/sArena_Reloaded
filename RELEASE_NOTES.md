2.2.8
- A lot of work done towards TBC, it should now be in a decent state. Will probably require a decent bit of tweaks and spells etc. Any support is appreciated.
- Midnight: Tweak DR Borders with new available API so can actually hide the previous border instead of just overlapping it.
- Raise DR Frames' FrameLevel a bit.
