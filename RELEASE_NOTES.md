2.2.9
- Add health/mana background texture & color settings.
- Fix Pixelated layout's ClassIconCooldown not showing.
- Fix DR BorderFrame's FrameLevel to also be increased after the main DR Frame's FrameLevel increase.

2.2.8
- A lot of work done towards TBC, it should now be in a decent state. Will probably require a decent bit of tweaks and spells etc. Any support is appreciated.

- Raise DR Frames' FrameLevel a bit.
