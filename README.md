# sArena Reloaded

New and updated sArena Frames with tons of new great features. Works for Midnight, TWW, MoP, Wrath and TBC. Fork of sArena addon made by Stako, and maintained by many in the PvP community.

This is a further improvement of my sArena MoP Classic addon and it also brings it to Retail. This version will work on both Retail and MoP. This version will let you import settings from both sArena MoP and any other sArena version, see below.

This version comes packed with many new features such as:

*   Four new layouts and one updated one.
*   Import/Export feature for Profile Sharing.
*   Target/Focus/Combat/PartyTargets Indicators.
*   A smarter aura priority system
*   Dispel Icon (for Healer dispels by default but also things like Remove Curse & Mending Bandage)
*   Many new customisation options such as Texture, Font, Dark Mode, Icon Crop, Modern Castbars, Masque support, Text Positions, etc.
*   Put a unique texture on Healers specifically, or only when there is Class Stacking.
*   Show shields and overshields on healthbars.
*   Hunter's Feign Death does not show up as dead but instead gets faded out a little bit.
*   Frames are now class colored by default in starting room (with optional setting to keep default gray).
*   Castbars immediately hide for easier interrupts and only lingers if an interrupt lands and it will also say who interrupted it on the castbar for a short while.
*   Shows duration on auras that don't have durations implemented by default from Blizzard (Smoke Bomb, Earthen Wall, Barrier, etc)
*   Shadowsight timer.

Other improvements:

*   Interrupts take interrupt duration reduction auras into account
*   Healer Icon Replacement option
*   Class Color FrameTexture option
*   Bright DR setting to more easily destinguish DR amount.
*   Decimals on default CD Timer below 6 seconds.
*   Color Trinket setting to display Trinket CD as a flat Green/Red texture.
*   Option to display DR status as Text.
*   Black DR Border option.
*   Spec text on frames.
*   Class color names
*   Static DR setting with optional per class & per spec settings.
*   DR Categories: Per class & per spec settings.

And everything else you'd expect from Arena Frames.

### Import from other sArena versions

You can easily import your other sArena versions just by launching both addons at the same time and typing `/sarena` will open open a "Import Settings" window. From there you can chose which option you want to go with. When you chose "Import Settings" it will also disable the other addon for compatibility and save you some clicks.
